# Web Stack Debugging #1

This project focuses on debugging an Ubuntu container where Nginx is installed but not listening on port 80.  
The goal is to fix the issue and write a script that ensures Nginx runs properly on port 80 for all IPv4 addresses.

The script `0-nginx_likes_port_80` applies all required fixes automatically.
